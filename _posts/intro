I am a six sigma Master Black Belt truly passionate about data analytics. In the next few years, I really believe that the intellect to draw insightful knowledge from vast amounts of data and make meaningful decisions that can change the world will be widely sought after.

I have had the opportunity to work for world class companies in number of leadership roles driving strategic programs. In these companies I led transformational six sigma programs that led to increased customer satisfaction, achieved top-line eBusiness growth, improved business processes and eliminated non-value added processes. A powerful insight that I learned from these experiences was that the strategic use of data can drive behavior and mindset changes in organizations. 

I am really enjoying the Columbia Data Sciences programs, meeting diverse students and faculty. I am hoping to contribute in a small way to change the world from what I am learning from this program.
