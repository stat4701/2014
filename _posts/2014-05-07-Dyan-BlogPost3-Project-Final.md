* For this Blog Post # 3, I decided to addresses What's left in the project as given in the to-dos that can be found in the Recap Blog published earlier for my above Project. This completes the project with my findings and conclusions given in this Blog #3: <br> 


#### Data Visualization Tool #2:

 Using this tool I was able to answer all five (5) questions What? When? Where? Who? Why? from the Over-Time Data presented without having to navigate through other charts in other Tabs unlike Tool #1. This was accomplished by having further breakdowns (sub divisions) of the X and Y Axis. Using selectable items in the drop downs and picking the data range I could avoid the clutter if I am interested in only a subset of the data. Tool Tips provided the answer in numeric values. Black box represents the budgeted OT data and the actual OT data is placed inside the black box and if it exceeds the budget it turns Red and extends above the Black Box. If the actual OT is less than the Budget then the inside box is Green and contained fully inside the Black box. Yellow means they are almost equal. This tool uses a .NET API and a more development effort was involved than the Tool #1 which was almost like a Plug and Play. Although the learning curve was much higher, using the API provided a lot more flexibility as you can see in the results. This tool has a potential to give answers to even a sixth question. (Now I have only one item selected for the Y axis and there is no minor category selected although I could have used one more additional level if I needed) 

#### Following chart answers All 5W questions in 1: (What? When? Who? Why? Where?)

#### Decision Framework for Buying, Building, and Outsourcing Data Science Solutions:

#### Recommendations:

* "Build" solution is more suitable if you already have analytics skills in-house and your project requires a high level of granularity and control. 

* Consider the "Buy" solution option when packaged applications are available and the time to solution is more demanding. "Why re-invent the wheel? Does one size fits all? If not can we tweak it?"

* Consider the "Outsource" option if you don't have in-house skills to build your own solution and there is no packaged application that meets your requirements or needs customization if one exists. 

* If you build critical systems in-house make sure you have coverage through consulting arrangement or by any other means, in the event your lead developer leaves. 

* In making this decision to Buy-Build-Outsource ask the question what if the business requirements change what method will be affected most? If your business application depends on automatically scraping data from other web sites what will happen if the URL changed and your application stopped working. How to fix it?.

* No matter what choice you make, it is a good idea to have on staff a data scientist or a team of data scientists who understands the business.
