Hi all,

I think I've met about everyone in the program at this point, so I'm going to keep this short.  

I like this definition: 

Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. -[Josh Wills](https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656)

As a quant analyst at a consulting firm, I'm approaching Data Scientist from the stats side and hoping this program can beef up my programming skills, especially python and d3.
