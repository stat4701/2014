### Tennis Grand Slams junk chart

There are many junk sports charts on the Internet. I chose this one about tennis because the author made a good concerted effort to demonstrate something interesting with simple data. These are the criticisms I had:
* The circle markers are large and do not make it easy to see when two points overlap
* The 'fitted' lines do not add much information in my opinion, but does add clutter
* The graphs were separated by Grand Slam, which makes sense because they are unique; but I thought that the importance of the four different events could have been demonstrated better with a different display style
* The first four rounds were clumped together, which I thought resulted in an unfortunate loss of information
* On a related note, I found I often had to refer to the scale key to figure out what round I was looking at, which was a bit of a nuisance
* The bar graph showing total number of championships for each Grand Slam was probably not necessary, especially if the new version of the graph was easier to read

### My improved (junk) chart

* I made clearer separations between the events
* I used filled circles for the markers, combined circles when there was an overlap, and added a border to distinguish the winner of a final v. the finalist
* I added a couple years, just to update it
* As I was making this chart I started looking at patterns in the finals, and thought it would be interesting to quantify the head-to-heads between the three players in Grand Slam finals. Although this information is also available in the charts themselves, I think having a summary bar graph was nice and interesting. For instance, Djokovic and Federer have surprisingly met only once in a Grand Slam final, with Federer taking that title. In addition, with the knowledge that Federer has won 17 Grand Slams, the bar chart shows that only three have been earned facing Nadal or Djokovic.

Thoughts, roadblocks
* Since this was a pretty simple graph, I was able to 'scrape' the data manually and use Illustrator to make the graph as I wanted it.
* I also found a tennis-related junk chart from WIRED magazine to improve on that would require a more sophisticated way of obtaining data. I am excited about improving this in several ways and will work on this if we have another 'junk chart' assignment (or if I have time this week).
