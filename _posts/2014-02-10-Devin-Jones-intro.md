## Background

My name is Devin Jones. I'm enrolled in Columbia's Data Science program. I have an acedemic background in mathematical statistics, economics, and operations research from Rutgers University. I have about 4 years work experience in the digital advertising industry. 


## What I do at work

At work I've been wrangling 5gb of ad server log data per day in SQL Server/T-SQL, applying various attribution methodologies, creating statistical modeling datasets, running analyses in SAS and presenting results in Tableau. I also help maintain marketing mix software in SAS that iterates through variable transformations in SAS to find the best fit model. 


## What I hope to learn

I hope to get more comfortable with R, Python and d3 this semester. I would love to use Python as a data extraction & munging tool as well as leverage some of its scientific libraries where applicable. I would also like to gain exposure to some NLP methologies to create social listening software at work.
