### My background
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/celene.JPG)<br>
I'm a Jersey Girl, and while not particularly proud of it I'll defend my state when necessary. Growing up I had always assumed I'd be a medical doctor because it was sciencey and didn't seem to depend on writing essays or understanding the law of gravity. In college I majored in Ecology & Evolutionary Bio, fulfilled the pre-med requirements, and took the MCAT. But my senior thesis experience got me thinking that research was kind of fun, and during my gap year I applied to both medical school and graduate school. (I wasn't qualified to be competitive for combined programs, and frankly wasn't interested in spending _that_ much more time in school. HA!) After interviews for both, I decided graduate school was a better fit.

Fast forward to last June, when I finished my PhD in Neuroscience and felt... lost. I didn't want to be an Academic and, despite the esteem associated with a doctorate degree, didn't have many other clear-cut options. So I moved to New York to join the husband and began exploring the Interweb.

### Why I'm in the Certification Program
I have had a long-standing interest in the Idea of Computer Programming. I considered a minor in the field before I started college - and then I took Introduction to Computer Programming. I was intimidated and finished the course believing I just didn't 'get' how to think like a programmer. So I moved on, dabbling occasionally, and even did a one-year program in Computational Biology (where we mainly worked in Matlab and R).

But the desire to do something computational never left me, and I was always looking for excuses to learn and apply computations to what I was doing. Then, late in graduate school, I came across an article about 'Big Data'. The field described a three-way marriage of my interests: research and analysis, programming, and practical applications (ahem, graduate school)! So, last summer, this is what I spent my time surfing the 'net for.

Then I signed up for the Columbia IDSE e-mail list, and... the rest is history.<br><br><br>


Well, not quite. The material I learned via Udacity + the Algorithms class last fall helped me land a job as a Software Engineer at [Datadog](http://www.datadoghq.com). Now I'm knee-deep in the programming world, and loving the challenge. I also love the not-brand-new startup environment. Feel free to ask me about any of these things.
