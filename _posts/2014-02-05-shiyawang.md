hi, i'm shiya. i discovered the magic of data analysis when i interned at lincoln center last summer. while there, i became fascinated by the amount of data that lincoln center had on its audience, as well as the power of turning data into useful insights to expand and diversify the classical music audience. i enjoyed being exposed to this new discipline, so much so that i decided to enroll in the data sciences program at columbia and apply for a masters in statistics. 

when i'm not doing anything data-related, i love going for runs in the morning, reading on the subway, and taking walks in the city. i graduated from harvard with a bachelors degree in english, and i'm excited to return as a masters student in statistics in the fall.
