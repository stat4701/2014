## Blog 2

I wanted to show, a little clearer, the data I found at http://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/nov2013_state_by_state_women_overall.pdf.  This first attempt is not much clearer, but was a good exercise in acquiring, cleaning, and joining data, and getting that data on a screen.  It currently only shows the same information as the original chart did, just with the exact numbers overlaid on top of the states themselves.

### To run
```
cd /projects/enkeboll/blog2
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```

In your browser, visit `localhost:8888` to view the map interactively.


## Blog 3

Blog 3 is forthcoming, and will augment the work I did on blog 2 by adding tool tips, legend, and options to change the data based on standard of living averages (which have already been pulled in the data, and just need to be accessed).
