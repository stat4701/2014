I graduated from Barnard College, Columbia University [2002]. I spent almost a decade on Wall Street as a trader/investment analyst in fixed income + foreign exchange.

I originally started as a pre-med major and thereby, wish to embark on my second career, in Health Analytics. I believe that the Data Science program will enable to make this transition.

In my former career, I have been exposed mostly to case-attribute form of data analysis. I am interested to explore and visualize data on a relational basis[networks, trees, clusters] in this class.
