      "## Database schema and extraction strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The database\n",
      "\n",
      "The hands are all No Limit Hold'em (NLHE) hands. There are two forms of NLHE games, tournaments and cash games. Tournaments are what are typically seen on television. Professional players typically spend most of their time in cash games, as tournaments have significantly more variance, which makes it exceedingly stressful to make a living.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hands were all played on the site PokerStars, in tables of maximum 6 players (known as 6-max games) in a format called Zoom. The game is called 200NL, which means it has a \\$2 big blind and \\$200 maximum buyin. This project will be measured in units of big blinds, so \\$2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Missingness\n",
      "\n",
      "One element that cannot be captured is the number of tables a player is playing. These are fast-paced games where most good players are playing around 1000 hands per hour. In addition, the site offers rewards in the form of \"rakeback\" which cannot be measured, as it depends on the volume of hands a player plays. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is also important to understand that poker is a game of hidden information. Unlike chess, where all information is shared by both players, each player has 2 hole cards that are not seen by the other player. This database does not contain that hidden information, and so the value of different hole cards in different situations cannot be measured. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are two ways a hand can end:\n",
      "\n",
      "* one player makes the rest of the players fold (i.e. they are unwilling to match that player's bet or raise).\n",
      "* two or more players complete all the betting action throughout the hand, and go to \"showdown,\" meaning that the best hand wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have hole card information only in the instances where the hands go to showdown. This information is mostly useless as \n",
      "\n",
      "* the hands at showdown are likely to be strong hands\n",
      "* the strong two-card holdings such as AA, KK, AK, etc. are more likely to get to showdown than a weak hand such as 72.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The approach\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that __the frequencies are what are truly important in poker.__ I have done a significant amount of work and research around game theory in poker, and I have found in many instances, the frequencies with which we take actions can be more important than the cards themselves. This is mostly true among the marginal hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyzing the frequencies and the statistics which represent these frequencies will be the approach I am taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "__TODO: Fix this afterwards__\n",
      "\n",
      "(not true anymore)\n",
      "Further, I will be running classification rather than regression. The reason for this is that there is significant variance in the game. Even with a sample of 50,000 or more hands on some players, there is still too much uncertainty in winrates for regression to be meaningful. Instead, I will look at players with a given p-value for being a winning player and others with a given p-value for being a losing player.\n",
      "(/ not true anymore)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One final point is that there is a metric that is slightly less susceptible to luck, that I'll refer to as EV winnings. Any time players are \"all-in\", the rest of the 5-card board is dealt. If one player is expected to win 60% of the time, EV winnings will count the winnings as if that player wins 60% of the pot. This doesn't remove all elements of luck from the game, but it is is a more stable metric than pure winrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### A note on player types\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason a person can profit playing poker is because the game is played amongst customers, while the site or casino takes a percentage \"rake\" from each put (on PokerStars, 4.5% up to \\$3 in these games). This separates poker from all other casino games.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, poker is seen as a hobby for millions of people around the world. Just as many people flock to Las Vegas playing craps and blackjack for entertainment, knowing they aren't \"supposed to\" win, many people play poker for entertainment. I will refer to these as \"casual players\" as opposed to \"regulars.\" We will be able to see this quickly by looking at the \"VP\\$IP\" and \"PFR\" stats, and I will remove these players from the analysis. __I want to observe what separates the winning regulars from the losing regulars__.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The extraction strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "The full database had roughly 9 million hands in total in a PostgreSQL database. I have software, Pokertracker4, which parses \"hand histories\" provided by PokerStars and puts them into a database. Since it is 6-max, there are roughly 50 million rows. Even pulling out 2 columns repeatedly caused my computer to run out of memory and crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I have done instead is import the hands into 4 PostgreSQL databases and handled them separately. Once I've combined the data, if I have enough winning players with the requisite p-value, I will randomly choose a test and validation set.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found more complex SQL statements were exceedingly slow, and so my approach was to pull the raw data out of the database and manipulate it in Python with pandas.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found a library called psycopg2 that allows me to pull the data right into a dataframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Project Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently went to a fantastic talk with Chris Wiggins, and he stressed the idea of keeping an eye on what we are actually doing. I am a person who easily goes off on tangents (which is obvious in my iteration plans), so I'm adding this part in an attempt to stick to the plan. This is a point at which I am also re-organizing these notebooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "* I will make reproduceable code so if I were to give this to a poker player who knows some python, he or she could run the initial code and get the data into a form to expand on the type of data analysis I'm doing here. He or she could also follow along and run the same algorithms or make the same plots I am with his or her own data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* I will find some statistics or traits that separate the winning regulars from the losing regulars\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* I will divide some of this by position (i.e. the seat a player is in relative to the dealer button)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* I will make some headway on analyzing the board texture (i.e. the distribution of the community cards)"
