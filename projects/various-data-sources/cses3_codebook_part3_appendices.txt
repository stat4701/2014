         | NOTES: PARTIES AND LEADERS
         |
         | This appendix identifies parties active during a polity's
         | election and (where available) their leaders.
         |
         | The party labels are provided for the codes used in the 
         | micro data variables. Parties A through F are the six 
         | most popular parties, listed in descending order according 
         | to their share of the popular vote in the "lowest" level 
         | election held (i.e., wherever possible, the first segment 
         | of the lower house).
         |
         | Leaders A through F are the corresponding party leaders or
         | presidential candidates referred to in the micro data items.
         | This appendix reports these names and party affiliations.
         |
         | Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties and leaders
         | voluntarily provided by some election studies. However,
         | these are in no particular order.
         |
         | If parties are members of electoral blocs, the name of 
         | the bloc is given in parentheses following the appropriate 
         | party labels.

         | Left.PDS had dual leadership in 2005, led by Lothar Bisky and
         | Oskar Lafontaine. However, Oskar Lafontaine and Gregor Gysi are
         | the ones asked about, since they were the most well-known and 
         | important politicians of the Left.PDS. Variables C3010_D and 
         | C3012_D reflect the respondent's evaluation of Oskar Lafontaine,
         | as the leader of the Left.PDS. 
         |
         | As a representative of Alliance 90 / Greens, Joschka Fischer was
         | mentioned in the German questionnaire. However, it should be
         | noted that J. Fischer has not been the party leader of the
         | Greens. These have been Reinhard Bütikofer and Claudia Roth. 
         | Yet, J. Fischer had been one of the most important politician of 
         | the German Greens and was evaluated in C3010_E and C3012_E.

         |
         | Remarks on CSES coding scheme for PARTY_C and PARTY_D:
         | 
         | In general, party labels A to I are order similar to the vote
         | share at the lowest tier, referring to the first vote choice in
         | the German national election. Consequently, the Left Party
         | received 11.1%, which was greater than the FDP (9.4%). However,
         | due to the second vote choice and the final distribution of
         | seats, the FDP got 93 seats (14.6%), compared
         | to 76 seats (11.9%) of the Left Party. Due to the distribution
         | of the seats, the FDP was defined as PARTY_C and the Left as 
         | PARTY_D.
         | 
         | The CDU is not eligible for election in Bavaria (election 
         | districts 213 to 257, region 9), while the CSU is eligible for
         | election in Bavaria, exclusively.
         |
         | Variables C3010_H and C3012_H refer to Mr. Karl-Theodor zu
         | Guttenberg, the German minister of defense, who is no official
         | leader of the CSU, but actually on of the most important 
         | politicians of this party.
         |
         | The actual leaders of the Green Party had neither been Renate
         | Künast nor Jürgen Trittin. Instead, the dual leadership was
         | kept by Claudia Roth and Cem Özdemir, who were not listed
         | in the original German questionnaire.
         |
         | The WASG was not eligible for election in 2009. Instead
         | the party fused in 2007 with the PDS and formed the Left Party.
         |
         | The actual leaders of the Left Party in 2009 had been Oskar
         | Lafontaine (included in C3010_D and C3012_D) and Lothar Bisky,
         | and neither were listed in the questionnaire. Rather,
         | variables C3010_I and C3012_I refer to Gregor Gysi, who is one 
         | of the most important politician of the Left Party beside Oskar
         | Lafontaine.
         |
         | C4004_G reports the district results for the National Democratic
         | Party (NPD), which was not included in the micro-questionnaire,
         | i.e. variables C3009_G, C3010_G, C3011_G, and C3012_G.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2008): PARTIES AND LEADERS
         |
         | The electoral system of Hong Kong Legislative Council
         | distinguishes between geographical and functional 
         | constituencies. In both constituencies 30 LegCo-members are
         | elected. The functional constituencies are due to professionals
         | or economical and social interest groups. For the CSES data,
         | C3023_LH_DC and C3032_LH_DC refer to the vote choice of 
         | the geographical constituencies, in which all registered
         | citizens are eligible to vote. 
         |
         | Researchers interested in the individual vote choices within the
         | functional constituencies might contact our collaborator of Hong
         | Kong (see Introduction Part of the current Codebook) to get 
         | access to the data of origin.
         |
         | Researchers should note that in contrast to the given coding 
         | schema, referring to parties, the original answers were 
         | candidate mentions. Accordingly, C3023_LH_DC and C3032_LH_DC 
         | only includes candidates' parties that have been registered for
         | respondents' geographical constituencies. 
         | In contrast, C3028_LH_ and C3030_LH_ also refer to candidates'
         | parties outside respondents' geographical constituencies.
         | Moreover, according to C3030_LH_, our collaborators noted 
         | that the label "'independents' in Hong Kong means 'not 
         | affiliated with any political parties' and does not necessarily
         | mean that the candidates' political inclinations are different
         | from those of major political parties".
         |
         | The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (code 9 is not 
         | included in C3009_E, C3010_E and C3011_E, due to not being part
         | of the questionnaire of origin. However, information about the
         | party is available in the district, as well as in the macro part
         | of CSES. Moreover, the official leader of The Hong Kong 
         | Federation of Trade Unions in 2008 has been Cheng Yiu-Tong, who 
         | was not mentioned in C3008_2.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - POLAND (2007): PARTIES AND LEADERS
         |
         | Note that the Polish study of 2007 used closed lists to ask for
         | party mentions in different questions. If respondent named a 
         | party out of the provided list, this answer was coded as 
         | "Others".
         |
         | The LiD (Left and Democrats) campaigned as a coalition of SLD, 
         | SDPL, UP, and PD in the 2007. Jaruga-Nowcka, who is mentioned as
         | one of the leaders of LID, was independent at that, in fact. In
         | contrast, in 2005 she was the leader of the Unia Lewicy.
         |
         | Between 2005 and 2007, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk changed from Unia
         | Wolnosci to Partia Demokratyczna.
         |
         | Code 87. "R would never vote for any party, except the one voted

         | Collaborators noted that in general Croatian electoral 
         | districts are not named but numbered. The list above reflects
         | this system, including Roman numeral according to the offical

         | includes all citizens who do not have a permanent residence in
