Since joining the IDSE Data Sciences Certification program, I have been introducing myself as a "full-time actuary, part-time data science student". First, the “full-time actuary” part; I work for a French life insurance company named AXA. Actuaries are basically the risk managers of the company. We project cash flows, determine reserves and capitals, buy hedges to mitigate risks, among other functions. My day-to-day work involves consolidating cash flows, and provides projection of how much money AXA needs to hold to meet policyholder obligations and regulatory requirements.
As for the “part-time data science student” part, that’s the reason why I’m here. I think actuary is a very analytical profession. But the tools that we use (mostly Excel and PowerPoint) are very out of date. It’s my goal to learn more state of the art tools in analytics and visualization, so that I can expand the horizon of my career. Beyond the career prospect, I want to stay aware of how the current wave of data evolution and technology advancement will impact the human society as a whole. 
I’m very much looking forward to learning from the professors and my fellow students.
